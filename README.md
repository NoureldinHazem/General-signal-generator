# General-signal-generator
It is required to implement a general signal generator that has the following specifications:</br>
1. When the program starts the program asks the user for the following parameters:</br>
a. Sampling frequency of signal.</br>
b. Start and end of time scale.</br>
c. Number of the break points and their positions (i.e. the points that the signal definition rule changes).</br>
2. According to the number of break points the program asks the user at each region to enter the specifications of the signal at this region which are:</br>
a. DC signal: Amplitude.</br>
b. Ramp signal: slope – intercept.</br>
c. General order polynomial: Amplitude-power – intercept.</br>
d. Exponential signal: Amplitude – exponent.</br>
e. Sinusoidal signal: Amplitude – frequency – phase.</br>
3. Display the resulting signal in time domain</br>
4. the program asks the user if he wants to perform any operation on the signal</br>
a. Amplitude Scaling: scale value.</br>
b. Time reversal.</br>
c. Time shift: shift value</br>.
d. Expanding the signal: expanding value</br>
e. Compressing the signal: compressing value</br>
f. None</br>
5. Display the new signal in time domain</br></br>
